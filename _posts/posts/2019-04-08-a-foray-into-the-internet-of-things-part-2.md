This is a bit belated.  Work has gotten in the way of hobby for sure.  At least, that's the excuse I'm sticking with.  I finally got wevedconnect set up properly on my Rasperry Pi.  I fought with sendmail configuration for some time, trying to get it to work with a Google.com email address.  It kept trying to use root@gmail.com or <username>@gmail.com.  I finally gave in and installed Citadel.  Citmail is so much easier and it works like a charm. I am extremely happy with the results so far.  Next steps are adding and configuring a domain name so I can send emails to my mail server.  I also want to harden it further before I get too much farther, but this is progress!

If anyone has suggestions for other nice-to-haves, or if you have done this before, I am certain there are roadblocks and problems that you are better at anticipating than I am, so hit me up.
